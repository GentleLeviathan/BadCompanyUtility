Bad Company Utility Shader Suite

A suite of tools and shaders designed for using assets inspired by Microsoft's 'Halo' assets in Unity.
Supports armor sets and textures from the following 'Halo' games:

* Halo Reach
* Halo: Combat Evolved
* Halo 2 (currently limited)
* Halo 3: ODST
* Halo 3
* Halo 4 (Storm)
* Halo 5: Forge

This suite was started for a project I have been working on for some time, but it slowly evolved into a universal set of tools for game rips to be utilized in user-content sandboxes such as VRChat.
As such, I may maintain two separate versions of the suite at a later date, one designed and modified for use in sandboxes such as above, and one for self-contained Unity projects.

This suite is licensed under the MIT License.

A quick disclaimer:
I do not condone reverse-engineering or pirating software, assets, or intellectual property.
This suite is only designed for working with assets inspired by Microsoft's 'Halo' universe.
You will not find any intellectual property in this repository.
